openfema-50,HazardMitigationPlanStatuses,Hazard Mitigation Plan Statuses,"The data found on this page comes from the Hazard Mitigation Planning Program’s Mitigation Planning Portal (MPP). The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.
Hazard mitigation planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters. It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area. After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding hazard mitigation planning. For more information, visit Hazard Mitigation Planning (https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/hazard-mitigation-planning )

Hazard mitigation plans enable state, tribal, territorial, and local governments to: 
<ul><li> Increase education and awareness around threats, hazards, risk, and vulnerabilities</li><li>Build partnerships for risk reduction with governments, organizations, businesses, and the public</li><li>Identify long-term strategies that seek to reduce risk</li><li>Align risk reduction with other state, tribal, territorial or local objectives</li><li>Identify implementation actions to focus resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities</li><li>Connect priorities to potential funding sources</li><li>Increase investment in mitigation actions</li></ul>

A FEMA-approved hazard mitigation plan is needed to receive certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance.

As part of disaster declarations, the President can make federal funding (Public Assistance) available through FEMA to eligible state, local and tribal governments and certain private nonprofit organizations. This is done on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair, replacement, or mitigation work for facilities damaged by the disaster event. 

As part of Congressional bill HR 152 - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA is providing the following information for our stakeholders: Region, Disaster Declaration Number, Disaster Type, State, Applicant, County, Damage Category Code, Federal Share Obligated, and Date Obligated.

Note: FEMA obligates funding for a project directly to the Recipient (State or Tribe). It is the Recipient's responsibility to ensure that the eligible subrecipient (listed in the dataset as Applicant Name) receives the award funding.

This dataset lists details about project versions (occurring when the scope/cost changes for a project). Versions adjust the cost of the project  with positive additions called obligations and subtractions called deobligations. Combined, they reconcile to reflect the Total Federal Share Obligation, but reconciliation occurs over the life of the project - sometimes years after the declaration date. The dataset represents project obligations within a seven-day period prior to the listed date but does not include obligations uploaded on the same day as the publication. Open projects still under pre-obligation processing are not represented. For more information on the Public Assistance process see: https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/process

openfema-60,PublicAssistanceApplicantsProgramDeliveries,Public Assistance Applicants Program Deliveries,"FEMA's Public Assistance (PA) Grants Manager database, including the Grant Portal tool (collectively Grants Manager) was developed in 2016 and became the processing system for all new PA grants starting on August  25, 2017. Grants Manager documents PA projects from formulation to grant obligation and finally close-out. Grant formulation is a new process that was not previously captured.

The previous database, the Emergency Management Mission Integration Environment (EMMIE) currently functions as the system for obligations - a few declarations are obligated in Grants Manager as test cases. All remaining EMMIE functions are scheduled to move to Grants Manager soon. This includes the records for EMMIE and the previous database, the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). 

The 'Public Assistance Applicants Program Deliveries' dataset was generated from Grants Manager by the PA reporting team to share data on assistance made available to eligible state, local and tribal governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations as part of presidentially declared disasters. This dataset reports on the PA National Delivery Model process with summaries of projects and project statuses for all active applicants (subrecipients). The data reflects time sensitive, current phase information including pre-obligation (project formulation) phases starting in phase 2 through obligation in phase 5.

Short description of the PA Phases: 
Phase 1. Applicant Coordination and Evaluation - Identify applicants’ disaster impacts and recovery priorities.
Phase 2. Impacts and Eligibility - Capture and document all incident-related damages.
Phase 3. Scoping and Costing - Further develop PA grant projects for final processing.
Phase 4. Final Reviews - FEMA reviews the project application, applicants review and sign agreement.
Phase 5. Obligation and Recovery Transition - FEMA obligates funds to recipients and schedules Recovery Transition Meeting (RTM).
Phase 6. Post-Award Monitoring and Amendments - Applicant provide updates to FEMA via Recipient, amendments can be submitted for changes to the scope, costs, or time to complete the project.
Phase 7. Final Reconciliation and Closeout - Applicant coordinates with recipient for closeout completed with FEMA.

openfema-85,PublicAssistanceGrantAwardActivities,Public Assistance Grant Award Activities,"This dataset contains data on Public Assistance project awards (obligations), including the project obligation date(s); dollar amount of Federal Share Obligated for each project and its obligation date(s); FEMA Region; State; Disaster Declaration Number; descriptive cause of the declaration (Incident Type); Entity requesting public assistance (Applicant Name); and distinct name for the repair, replacement or mitigation work listed for assistance (Project Title).  

As part of disaster declarations, the President can make federal funding (Public Assistance) available through FEMA to eligible state, local and tribal governments and certain private nonprofit organizations. This is done on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair, replacement, or mitigation work for facilities damaged by the disaster event. 

As part of Congressional bill HR 152 - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA is providing the following information for our stakeholders: Region, Disaster Declaration Number, Disaster Type, State, Applicant, County, Damage Category Code, Federal Share Obligated, and Date Obligated.

Note: FEMA obligates funding for a project directly to the Recipient (State or Tribe). It is the Recipient's responsibility to ensure that the eligible subrecipient (listed in the dataset as Applicant Name) receives the award funding.

This dataset lists details about project versions (occurring when the scope/cost changes for a project). Versions adjust the cost of the project  with positive additions called obligations and subtractions called deobligations. Combined, they reconcile to reflect the Total Federal Share Obligation, but reconciliation occurs over the life of the project - sometimes years after the declaration date. The prior version of this dataset included project obligations within a seven-day period prior to the listed date. This version includes obligations from 1998 to present, excluding obligations uploaded on the same day as the publication. Open projects still under pre-obligation processing are not represented. For more information on the Public Assistance process see: https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/process

openfema-35,IpawsArchivedAlerts,IPAWS Archived Alerts,"The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) is a modernization of the nation's alert and warning infrastructure that unifies the United States' Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems implemented as a set of Web services. IPAWS was designed to modernize these systems by enabling alerts to be aggregated over a network and distributed to the appropriate system for public dissemination.
Organized and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state, local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the public using a range of national and local alerting systems.
This data set contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement, Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe. It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. 
*The dataset is published with a twenty-four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty-four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively.  Information on signing up for receiving active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system . To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov.
The data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf

This is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450 Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability so if the site goes down, the information will be inaccessible. This is a rare occurrence. 
Earlier messages may contain non-compliant geocoordinates. Recent versions of the software check these coordinates for compliance. 
This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report and should not be considered an official federal report.  If you are using this site for other than research purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after the official IPAWS message has been sent. 
Note that the original IPAWS CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original format. If no such tool is available to you, online utilities exist, such as https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape that will decode the message. See the originalMessage field description for additional details.
Due to its size and its hierarchical data structure, working with the IPAWS Archived Alerts file can be challenging.

openfema-86,NfipResidentialPenetrationRates,NFIP Residential Penetration Rates,"NFIP ""take-up rates"" or residential penetration rates are an estimate of the percentage of total residential structures covered by an NFIP policy. The NFIP residential penetration rate within an area, such as a county, is the ratio of insured residential structures to total residential structures in that area. Private flood insurance take-up rates are not available to FEMA and therefore, are not included in these estimates. This data can be used for various planning purposes to evaluate community resilience and residual flood risk, help states better understand areas vulnerable to flooding and provide guidance for flood insurance marketing. FEMA derives the number of total residential structures from the 2019 National Structure Inventory (NSI) 2.0. 

Data in this report pertains to RESIDENTIAL properties only.
Incompleteness of NSI 2.0 can lead to the tables showing lower than actual numbers of total residential building stock and inflate the penetration rate.

openfema-79,MissionAssignments,Mission Assignments,"A mission assignment (MA) is a work order issued by FEMA to another Federal agency in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster. Mission assignments are authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act). More information about MAs is available at https://www.fema.gov/partnerships/mission-assignments. The Stafford Act, as amended, directs FEMA to publish regularly updated mission assignment data on its website. Please read this entire page, as it contains important notes for understanding how to use this dataset correctly. 

This updated version provides a history of FEMA mission assignment activity for incidents or disaster declarations occurring on or after October 1, 2012. It expands on the previous version by adding pre-declaration (“surge”) MA activity, subject to a two-week delay. It also adds several new data points (“fields”), renames others, and removes those deemed no longer relevant. Together, these changes provide a more holistic view of MA activity in response to incidents and declarations occurring in fiscal year 2013 and later.

FEMA tracks mission assignment activity in relation to overarching incidents (such as Hurricane Ian, Tropical Storm Lee, or the Calf Canyon Fire), as well as to the emergency or major disaster declarations that may result in one or more impacted states, tribes, or territories. Surge activity is identified by code ‘7220’ in the Declaration Number and ‘SU’ in the Declaration Type. 

Each row (“record”) in this dataset represents a mission assignment “action,” which is either the creation of a new mission assignment, or the amendment of an existing assignment. These actions are uniquely identified by a combination of MA Number with MA Amendment Number (which is zero for a new MA and increases by one for each MA amendment). Action ID also serves as a unique record number for each MA action. 

The details of a mission assignment often change over time as needs for support evolve. Mission assignments are amended for certain changes, such as periods of performance, points of contact, costs, and/or cost share percentages. However, mission assignments involving changes to the statement of work or funding source (surge account, emergency declaration, or major disaster declaration) are re-issued as new mission assignments; they are not amended. When this happens, funding from the preceding mission assignment generally is de-obligated from the initial funding source and re-obligated under the new mission assignment, along with any cost adjustments if needed. To understand all actions associated with a particular mission assignment, group the records in this dataset by MA Number. (Note: This will not group re-issued mission assignments with their predecessors.)

Because certain characteristics can change over the life of a mission assignment, the most recent amendment generally contains the most up-to-date information for that mission assignment, except for costs (explained next). 

Obligation amounts do not reflect actual costs incurred; they reflect the anticipated amount of money needed to fund the work described. Obligation amounts are based on best estimates, which include cushions designed to ensure adequate resources are available to address the stated needs. As better estimates become available, obligation amounts are adjusted via mission assignment amendments. 

To determine all estimated costs associated with a particular mission assignment, group the records in this dataset by MA Number and sum the obligation amounts for each action by MA Number. Over time, this sum will approach and eventually should match actual mission assignment costs, once billing and reimbursement activity is complete.
 
Cost shares are treated differently and are not as easily summed. FEMA has created a set of MA-specific fields to use in summary reporting. The MA POP start date, MA POP end date, MA state/tribe/territory cost share percentage, MA federal cost share percentage, and MA Priority in each MA action show the correct values for the MA Number as a whole, based on the most recent MA amendment. Similarly, the MA state/tribe/territory cost share amount and MA federal cost share amount show the correct amounts for each MA action, calculated using the percentages from the most recent MA amendment. 

Conversely, the POP start date, POP end date, state/tribe/territory cost share percentage, federal cost share percentage, and priority show the values that were correct at the time of each MA action. Further, the state/tribe territory cost share amount and federal cost share amount show the amounts that were correct at the time of each MA action. 

For these reasons, the MA state/tribe/territory cost share amount and MA federal cost share amount values can be summed by MA Number, whereas the state/tribe/territory cost share amount and federal cost share amount values cannot. All cost shares are calculated by multiplying the applicable cost share percentage by the obligation amount.

In rare instances, mission assignments for disasters declared prior to October 1, 2012 may not yet be fiscally closed. Those mission assignments are not reflected in this dataset, nor are any mission assignment actions taken on or after October 1, 2012 that relate to those disaster declarations. 

Due to administrative changes over time, Agency names for certain MA actions may contain text such as ""DO NOT USE"" or ""AMENDMENT."" These agency names should be ignored in favor of the plain language names also associated with those same Agency IDs in other MA records.

This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting and should not be considered an official federal report.

The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas (county not available before 1964; Fire Management records are considered partial due to historical nature of the dataset).

Please note the unique structure of the disaster sequencing (due to a numbering system that originated in the 1950's-1970's):
0001-1999     Major Disaster Declaration
2000-2999     Fire Management
3000-3999     Emergency Declaration (Special Emergency)
4000-4999     Major Disaster Declaration
5000-5999     Fire Management

openfema-78,NfipMultipleLossProperties,NFIP Multiple Loss Properties,"This dataset provides information on structures that have had multiple National Flood Insurance (NFIP) claims across the history of the program. The data contains NFIP-insured structures that fall within the four categories of Repetitive Loss and Severe Repetitive Loss that FEMA tracks. Definitions of these categories are provided in the field descriptions. There are also fields to show whether a structure is currently NFIP-insured, has been mitigated, and other characteristics. The data includes properties that have since been mitigated or demolished and may no longer considered to be in any of the listed categories.
An online map of this data can be found on FEMA's ArcGIS Online platform: https://fema.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=872bbaf7dfbb48cb88d244c7123e4d9d
Location information has been redacted to protect personal privacy. Location information is derived from reported address, geocoding of that address, and reported NFIP community. Because NFIP insurance claims data spans the history of the NFIP, many of the structures have poor address information resulting in poor or missing coordinates and additional location fields that rely on those coordinates. An effort has been made to fill in missing data and resolve conflicts between state, county, community, and census block group. Because of this effort, <em>statistics derived from this data may differ from those reported elsewhere by FEMA or others</em>.
There is a lot of interest in this data as it touches many program areas of the NFIP and serves as an indicator of flood risk and mitigation need.

openfema-66,EmergencyManagementPerformanceGrants,Emergency Management Performance Grants,"This dataset contains EMPG recipients as reported by their State and a summary of 
the funded program support as reported by the Recipient in the GRT.

The EMPG Program provides resources to assist state, local, tribal and territorial governments in preparing for all hazards, as authorized by Section 662 of the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (6 U.S.C § 762) and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§ 5121 et seq.). Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards, and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the federal government and the states and their political subdivisions. The EMPG, from FY 2016 to the present FY,provides federal funds to assist state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support the National Preparedness Goal's (NPG's) associated mission areas and core capabilities. The Federal Government, through the EMPG Program, provides necessary direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title to support a comprehensive all hazards emergency preparedness system. 

The EMPG is to support a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency preparedness system by building and sustaining the core capabilities contained in the NPG’s. Examples include: 

• Completing the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA)process.
• Strengthening a state or community's emergency management governance structure.
• Updating and approving specific emergency plans.
• Designing and conducting exercises that enable whole community stakeholders to examine and validate core capabilities and the plans needed to deliver them to the targets identified through the THIRA.
• Targeting training and verifying identified capabilities.
• Initiating or achieving a whole community approach to security and emergency management. 

This dataset was first made public on 10/31/2016 and will be updated twice a year.

openfema-15,NonDisasterAssistanceFirefighterGrants,Non-Disaster and Assistance to Firefighter Grants,"The Grant Programs Directorate strategically and effectively administers and manages FEMA grants to ensure critical and measurable results for customers and stakeholders. The grants represented in this dataset are Preparedness (Non-Disaster or ND) Grants and Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG).

ND Grants and AFG are awarded and managed differently within the Grants Program Directorate (GPD) and should be treated with discretion.

The only measure in this dataset is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.

AFG awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.

Grants guidance is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives, and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants

The Project Site Inventory contains information regarding the Building, Infrastructure/Utility/other, and/or Vacant Land proposed to be mitigated by the subapplication/subgrant. Sensitive information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), has been removed to protect privacy. The information in this dataset has been deemed appropriate for publication to empower public knowledge of mitigation activities and the nature of HMA grant programs.

This dataset comes from the source system mentioned above and is subject to a small percentage of human error. In some cases, data was not provided by the subapplicant, applicant, and/or entered into FEMA GO. Due to the voluntary nature of the Hazard Mitigation Assistance Programs, not all Project Site Inventory in this dataset will be mitigated. As FEMA GO continues development, additional fields may be added to this dataset to indicate the final status of individual inventory.

HMGP (Disaster Numbers 820-1999, 4000-4999)
Section 404 of the Stafford Act authorized the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The key purpose of HMGP is to ensure that the opportunity to take critical mitigation measures to reduce the risk of loss of life and property from future disasters is not lost during the reconstruction process following a disaster. The amount of HMGP funding available to the Applicant is based upon the total Federal assistance to be provided by FEMA for disaster recovery under the Presidential major disaster declaration.

Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) HMGP (Disaster Numbers 5084-5117)
Section 570 of the Fiscal Year 2015 DHS Appropriations Act authorized FEMA to provide HMGP assistance as a result of an FMAG declaration. FMAG HMGP was run as a pilot program and funding was provided as a national aggregate calculation based on an average of historical FMAG designations from the last five years.

HMGP Post Fire (Disaster Numbers 5154-5999)
Section 1204 of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 amended Section 404 of the Stafford Act to authorize FEMA to provide HMGP assistance in any area affected by a major disaster, or any area affected by a fire for which assistance was provided under Section 420 Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG). Funding from multiple events is aggregated into one grant under the first declaration. The Aggregation is reset at the beginning of each fiscal year and remains in effect for that year.

openfema-73,FimaNfipClaims,FIMA NFIP Redacted Claims,"Congress passed the National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA), 42 U.S.C. 4001 in 1968, creating the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) in order to reduce future flood losses through flood hazard identification, floodplain management, and providing insurance protection. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA's Write Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. 

The paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. 

This dataset provides details on NFIP claims transactions. It is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.

The Flood Insurance Claims Manual (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/insurance-manuals) provides claims guidance to WYOs, vendors, adjusters, and examiners so that policyholders experience consistent and reliable service. The Manual provides processes for handling claims from the notice of loss to final payment. The NFIP has provided answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to assist the public in understanding and navigating the data our program makes available: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nfip-data-faqs.pdf.

This dataset represents more than 2,000,000 claims transactions. In order to improve accessibility, we have one compressed file. Due to the file size we recommend using Access, SQL, or another programming/data management tool to visualize and manipulate the data, as Excel will not be able to process files this large without data loss.

openfema-23,IndividualAssistanceHousingRegistrantsLargeDisasters,Individual Assistance Housing Registrants - Large Disasters,"Individual Assistance (IA) is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters. It is intended to meet basic needs and supplement disaster recovery efforts.

Homeowners, renters, and business owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles, personal property, businesses, or inventory resulting from a federally declared disaster may apply for disaster assistance. For more informantion, see: https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual/program/eligibility

Disaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses.

Disaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs, welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.

This dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the IA program, comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information, see FEMA's IHP unified guidance document: https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/IHP_Unified_Guidance_FINAL_09272016_0.pdf

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA's Individual Assistance (IA) program as the system of record. The Large Disasters dataset contains a curated set of disasters for which individuals applied for Individual Assistance. This dataset only contains some of the largest disasters. No new disasters will be added to this dataset. It differs from the IHP Valid Registrations dataset in that it contains invalid registrants and includes the Census Block Group. The Valid Registration dataset contains all disasters, but only for those individuals that are approved or valid.

The data can be used to analyze FEMA's IA program response attributes. This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental organizations administer applications for funding from the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding during the costliest hurricane season of 2017.

OpenFEMA users can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.


Please note that there may be some inconsistent address format and systems, address and location reporting translation/miscues, and standard FEMA Geolocation algorithms ill fitted to O-CONUS addresses. Addresses in Puerto Rico and the way they are reported or even understood by survivors and local officials do not match well with the standard use Geocoders (algorithms that take an address and assign it to its  coordinate (x, y/latitudal, longitudinal location on the earth)). When geocoders cannot find an on structure/parcel/point match they tend to place a point at the geographic center of various polygon boundaries (zip code, City/barrio, Municipio, etc.), this at least puts the point in the vicinity of the address provided.  This is done from a spatial analytics perspective which will still allow the point to be count in an aggregate and still be useful in helping to formulate the bigger picture.

The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. 

The paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. 

This dataset provides details on NFIP policy transactions. It is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.

The Flood Insurance Manual (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/insurance-manuals) provides NFIP underwriting policies and processes to enable effective and consistent program implementation. The NFIP has provided answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to assist the public in understanding and navigating the data our program makes available:-  https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nfip-data-faqs.pdf.


This dataset represents more than 80,000,000 policy transactions. In order to improve accessibility, we have one compressed file. Due to the file size we recommend using Access, SQL, or another programming/data management tool to visualize and manipulate the data, as Excel will not be able to process files this large without data loss. The dataset will be updated approximately monthly and will have a lag with the system of record. 
 
This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report.
